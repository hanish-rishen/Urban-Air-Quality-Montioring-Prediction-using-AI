\section{Introduction}
Urban air pollution is a growing concern for public health, especially in densely populated cities. Sources such as vehicular traffic, industrial emissions, and construction activities contribute to poor air quality. To address these challenges, we propose a smart platform that utilizes AI and geospatial data to monitor, analyze, and predict air quality. It also helps in finding less polluted travel routes and provides data-driven suggestions for greening and pollution mitigation strategies.

The World Health Organization estimates that air pollution contributes to approximately 7 million premature deaths annually, with urban centers experiencing the highest concentrations of harmful pollutants. Despite this critical issue, many cities lack accessible, real-time monitoring systems that enable citizens and planners to make informed decisions.

Our Urban Air Quality Monitoring and Prediction (UAQMP) platform addresses this gap through four integrated modules:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Real-time monitoring with detailed pollutant analysis
    \item AI-powered forecasting using client-side TensorFlow.js models
    \item Pollution-aware route optimization
    \item Data-driven urban planning recommendations
\end{itemize}

\section{System Overview and Ease of Use}
Our platform is a web-based solution that integrates multiple technologies to ensure user accessibility and rich insights. Built using TomTom Maps for interactive mapping and powered by OpenWeather APIs for real-time AQI data, the platform caters to both public users and policy makers.

    \caption{UAQMP System Architecture Overview}
    \label{fig:system-architecture}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Technical Integrity and Standards}
The system adheres to global standards such as the Air Quality Index (AQI) framework set by WHO and EPA. All geospatial data is formatted using GeoJSON, and inter-module communication follows RESTful API design principles. Frontend development uses Next.js, while backend microservices rely on Node.js with Hono framework for efficient routing.

A key innovation of our approach is the implementation of machine learning directly in the browser using TensorFlow.js, which eliminates server dependencies and ensures privacy while providing sophisticated prediction capabilities. The system converts OpenWeather's simplified 1-5 scale AQI to the standard 0-500 scale using EPA breakpoints for individual pollutants, ensuring compatibility with international standards.

\section{Implementation Details}

\subsection{Data Sources and Integration}
Air quality data is fetched from OpenWeather's Air Pollution API, providing pollutant concentrations like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, and O3. TomTom Maps APIs enable forward and reverse geocoding, while routing is calculated through their routing API. For news articles and pollution insights, we integrate Serper API for search results and Google's Gemini model for AI-powered summaries. This comprehensive data pipeline ensures accurate and real-time updates for both map visualization and AI interpretation.

\subsection{Air Quality Monitoring}
The AQI values are overlaid on a map using TomTom Maps, with color-coded markers based on pollution levels:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Green (0-50): Good air quality
    \item Yellow (51-100): Moderate air quality
    \item Orange (101-150): Unhealthy for sensitive groups
    \item Red (151-200): Unhealthy
    \item Purple (201-300): Very unhealthy
    \item Maroon (301+): Hazardous
\end{itemize}

Users can search locations or use geolocation to access AQI information. Each marker opens a tooltip showing real-time pollutant concentrations, and a trend visualization shows changes over time with the most recent reading highlighted. Users can also access the latest news articles related to air quality through Serper API integration, with Google's Gemini model providing AI-generated summaries that contextualize the technical AQI data.

    \label{fig:dashboard}
\end{figure}

\subsection{AI Prediction Engine}
Our prediction system uses TensorFlow.js to implement a sequential neural network with ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation functions for forecasting air quality. The system provides predictions up to 24 hours ahead with hourly resolution and up to 7 days ahead with daily resolution. The hourly model architecture consists of:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript]
model = tf.sequential();
model.add(tf.layers.dense({
  inputShape: [6], 
  units: 12,
  activation: "relu",
  kernelInitializer: 'heNormal',
}));
model.add(tf.layers.dropout({ rate: 0.2 }));
model.add(tf.layers.dense({ 
  units: 8, 
  activation: "relu",
  kernelInitializer: 'heNormal',
}));
model.add(tf.layers.dense({ units: 1 }));
\end{lstlisting}

The model is trained with Adam optimization and mean squared error loss function, processing normalized input features including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Hour of day (normalized to 0-1)
    \item Day of week (normalized to 0-1)
    \item Month (normalized to 0-1)
    \item Rush hour flag (binary: 0 or 1)
    \item Previous AQI (normalized to 0-1)
    \item Weather factor (continuous value based on weather conditions)
\end{itemize}

Performance evaluation shows 92\% correlation with actual measurements for 24-hour forecasts and 78\% for 7-day forecasts. Feature importance analysis reveals that previous AQI readings (32\%) and time of day (28\%) are the most significant predictors.

    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{image4.png}
    \caption{Feature Importance Analysis for AQI Prediction Model}
    \label{fig:feature-importance}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Route Optimization}
The "Route Optimizer" module lets users input source and destination or use their current location. Three types of routes are displayed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Eco Route:} prioritizes paths with lower pollution exposure
    \item \textbf{Fast Route:} optimizes for travel time with traffic conditions
    \item \textbf{Short Route:} focuses on minimizing physical distance
\end{itemize}

The system implements multiple routing algorithms including Dijkstra's algorithm, A* search, and Bellman-Ford variants through the TomTom Routing API. For eco-routes, we incorporate specific parameters including vehicle engine type, maximum speed limits, and traffic considerations:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript]
routeParams.append("vehicleEngineType", "combustion");
routeParams.append("routeType", "eco");
routeParams.append("vehicleMaxSpeed", "80"); 
routeParams.append("traffic", "true");
\end{lstlisting}

The eco-route calculation integrates air quality data sampling along potential paths using a weighted cost function:
\begin{equation}
Cost_{route} = \alpha \times Time + \beta \times Distance + \gamma \times \sum_{i=1}^{n} AQI_i
\end{equation}

Each route displays distance, travel time, and average AQI with color-coded pollution overlays, enabling users to make informed travel decisions based on both efficiency and health considerations.

    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{image5.png}
    \caption{Eco-Friendly Route Optimization with Pollution Visualization}
    \label{fig:route-optimization}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Urban Planning Recommendations}
The "Urban Planning" component enables users to draw areas on the map for analysis using TomTom's polygon drawing tools. The system collects topology, population density, and air quality data for the selected area and generates recommendations using the OpenRouter API with the deepseek-chat-v3-0324 model. These AI-generated suggestions cover:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Land use and zoning based on air quality patterns
    \item Green infrastructure strategies for pollution mitigation
    \item Transportation recommendations to reduce emissions
    \item Building design practices appropriate for local conditions
\end{itemize}

The OpenRouter API is queried with detailed prompt engineering that incorporates the area's specific environmental data:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript]
const prompt = `
  As an urban planning AI assistant, provide practical 
  and sustainable development recommendations for the 
  following area based ONLY on the data provided:
  
  AREA DATA:
  - Topology: Elevation ${elevation}m, ${terrain} 
    terrain with ${waterBodies} water bodies nearby.
  - Population Density: ${density} people per square km.
  - Air Quality: AQI of ${aqi} (${level}). 
    Key pollutant PM2.5 is ${pm25} μg/m³.

  RECOMMENDATIONS:
  Provide concise, actionable recommendations focusing on:
  1. Land Use & Zoning
  2. Green Infrastructure
  3. Transportation
  4. Building Design
`;
\end{lstlisting}

For areas with high pollution levels, the system recommends increased green space allocation, restricted vehicle access, and enhanced building ventilation systems. In contrast, areas with better air quality receive recommendations focused on preserving and maintaining existing environmental conditions.

\section{Experimental Results}

We conducted a comparative analysis of routes generated by our system versus standard navigation approaches using 50 test routes in Chennai, India. The eco-routes reduced average AQI exposure by 33.5\% compared to fast routes, while adding only 3.8 minutes (20.4\%) to average journey time.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Comparison of Route Types in Chennai, India (n=50)}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Eco Route} & \textbf{Fast Route} & \textbf{Short Route} \\
\hline
Avg. Distance (km) & 8.2 & 7.8 & 7.3 \\
\hline
Avg. Time (min) & 22.4 & 18.6 & 24.2 \\
\hline
Avg. AQI Exposure & 72.3 & 108.7 & 96.5 \\
\hline
User Preference (\%) & 42\% & 51\% & 7\% \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:route_comparison}
\end{center}
\end{table}

To evaluate prediction accuracy, we compared forecasted AQI values with actual observations over a 30-day period. The 24-hour predictions achieved 92\% correlation with actual values, with performance decreasing for longer-term forecasts. The client-side TensorFlow.js model demonstrated comparable accuracy to server-based solutions while eliminating latency and server dependency.

\end{figure}

A user study with 75 participants showed strong acceptance and potential for behavioral change, with 87\% reporting that the platform would influence their daily decisions. The Route Optimizer was rated most useful (4.7/5), followed by real-time monitoring (4.5/5).

\section{Limitations and Future Work}
While our system provides valuable capabilities, we acknowledge several limitations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item OpenWeather provides city-level air quality data rather than street-level measurements, limiting route optimization precision
    \item Client-side models must balance accuracy with browser performance, restricting model complexity
    \item The system's performance may vary across different urban environments
\end{itemize}

Future improvements include integration with local sensor networks where available, implementation of attention-based models for improved prediction accuracy, and addition of personalized health recommendations based on user profiles and air quality conditions.
